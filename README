This is the master package for the whole hnet effort. It tracks the
sub-repositories as git submodules, and provides convenience
facilities for:

- setting up custom NetKit environment (amd64-arch with Linux 3.8, and
  wheezy Debian)

 (make netkit.build)

- building OpenWRT UML image which has the 'useful bits' for hnet (+
  Netkit integration)

 (make openwrt.build)

- network topology utilities
 
 (pending)

- updating the OpenWRT feed based on the most recent version of the components

 (component/ => openwrt/feed/*/Makefile automatic update)

 (pending)
