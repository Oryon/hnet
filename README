This is the master package for the whole hnet effort. It tracks the
sub-repositories as git submodules, and provides convenience
facilities for:

- setting up custom NetKit environment (amd64-arch with Linux 3.8, and

- building OpenWRT UML image which has the 'useful bits'

- network topology utilities
